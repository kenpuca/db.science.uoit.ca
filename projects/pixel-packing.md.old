There are over 1.5 million IMDB movie entries, and roughly the same number of
pixels on a mobile device.  Is it possible to build an algorithm to map each
movie to a single pixel for the purpose of data visualization?

We are looking into ways of discovering graph structures based on a relational
database, and then use the graph structure to generate a pixel level data
visualization of (up to) millions of relational entities.
