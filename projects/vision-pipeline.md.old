Computer Vision algorithms are challenging to implement. The data input is a big
data stream, and the intermediate processors often require fine tuning.

We are investigating the applications of streaming database technology to enable
rapid development, deployment and tuning of computer vision workflow by the
means of formal streaming algebra and structural optimization of algebraic
expressions.
